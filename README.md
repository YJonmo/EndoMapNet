This is the reference implementation for training and testing depth and pose estimation models using the method described in

This repository is modified version of [Monodepth2](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2) in order to incorportate pose supervision in the original self supervised implementation. Please reference the mentioned papers if you you are using this repository. 

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup

conda install pytorch=0.4.1 torchvision=0.2.1 -c pytorch
pip install tensorboardX==1.4

It is tested on Ubuntu 18 and cuda 10. 

A pretrained model on limited number of images (~8300) is provided. For your application further training might be required. 
Sample training and validation data are provided. 


## üñºÔ∏è Prediction for a single image

You can predict scaled disparity for a single image with:

```shell
python test_simple.py --image_path assets/test_image.jpg --model_name mono+stereo_640x192
```

or, if you are using a stereo-trained model, you can estimate metric depth with

```shell
python test_simple.py --image_path assets/test_image.jpg --model_name mono+stereo_640x192 --pred_metric_depth
