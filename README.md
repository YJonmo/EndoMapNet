This repository is modified version of [Monodepth2](https://github.com/nianticlabs/monodepth2) in order to incorportate pose supervision in the original self supervised implementation. Please reference the mentioned papers if you you are using this repository. 

For sample use, please refer to the colab link:

It is tested on Ubuntu 18 and cuda 10.
